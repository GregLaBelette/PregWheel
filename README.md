<h2>PregWheel is...</h2>

My first Vanilla JavaScript project, just having finished the JavaScript course on Mozilla Developpers Network.

A web app, created with a Midwife for the use of midwives and pregnant women.

It is a simple pregnancy calendar, doing a comparison between a conception (or last period) date and a lookup date (which defaults with system date). It displays important medical appointments which happen during pregnancy and time left for having these appointments done.

Events are displayed on a wheel which can be rotated to change the lookup date

Teh app is made to be a fullscreen mobile-ready PWA


<h2>Some challenges it made me think about...</h2>

  - Parsing a CSV file used as database
  - Comparing dates with Date API -> Dealing with F#-ing summer / winter time
  - Responsiveness (Mobile / Desktop & Landscape / Portrait)
  - Managing click & touch events
  - Displaying "time left" with words (a conditionals exercise)
  - Re-style some JQuery for the datepickers
  - Use Canvas to draw wheel
  - Workaround to get crisp canvas graphics event on Retina (PixelRatio) displays


  <h2>A few things I would like to learn & do differently</h2>

  - Probably would use Moment.JS to manage dates
  - Probably would use CSV rather than CANVAS
  - Probably would make a back-end and DB instead of CSV file
  - Would split up Script into several files
  - Would look for a datepicker not needing JQuery?
  - Would separate date calculation from display functions
  - Would try a front-end framework to manage responsiveness


<h3>This was a first try, would love to get some advice to make it better / get some good coding habits!</h3>
